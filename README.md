# Vista - The React Framework for Visionaries

> **⚠️ ALPHA SOFTWARE WARNING**
>
> Vista is currently in **alpha stage**. It is not recommended for production use yet. APIs and features may change without notice. Use at your own risk.

Vista is a modern, high-performance React framework built for the creators of tomorrow. It combines the component model of React with the raw speed of Rust, delivering an unparalleled development experience and lightning-fast production builds.

## 🚀 Powers & Features

Vista is designed to be the foundation for the next generation of web applications:

*   **React Server Components (RSC):** Default server-side rendering for optimal performance and zero-bundle-size components.
*   **Rust-Powered Core:** Built with Rust and SWC for blazing fast transpilation, minification, and bundling.
*   **Instant HMR:** Hot Module Replacement that scales with your project, keeping development feedback loops instant.
*   **File-Based Routing:** Intuitive routing system based on the file system structure.
*   **TypeScript Native:** First-class TypeScript support out of the box.
*   **Streaming SSR:** Stream content to the client as it's generated, improving perceived load times.
*   **Global Layouts:** Powerful layout system for persistent naming and state.
*   **Optimized Image Component:** Built-in `vista/image` for automatic image optimization.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

Vista is built on the shoulders of giants:

*   **Rust:** For the core CLI, file scanning, and performance-critical tasks.
*   **React 19:** Leveraging the latest React features including Server Components and Actions.
*   **SWC:** For super-fast JavaScript/TypeScript compilation.
*   **Webpack 5:** Highly tuned for module bundling (with Rust-based loaders).
*   **Node.js:** For the server runtime environment.

## 📦 Installation

To create a new Vista project:

```bash
npx create-vista-app@latest my-app
cd my-app
npm run dev
```

To create a project with the experimental typed API starter:

```bash
npx create-vista-app@latest my-app --typed-api
cd my-app
npm run dev
```

## 🧪 Experimental Typed API (Package-First)

Vista now includes an experimental typed API layer designed as package APIs first:

- `@vistagenic/vista/stack` for server router/procedure DSL
- `@vistagenic/vista/stack/client` for typed client calls
- CLI generators are convenience only (`vista g ...`)

Enable it in `vista.config.ts`:

```ts
const config = {
  experimental: {
    typedApi: {
      enabled: true,
      serialization: 'json', // or 'superjson'
      bodySizeLimitBytes: 1048576,
    },
  },
};

export default config;
```

Rollback is immediate by setting:

```ts
experimental: { typedApi: { enabled: false } }
```

## 💫 A Note to Young Developers

**You are not too young. You are not too inexperienced. You are exactly where you need to be.**

The greatest technologies were not built by those who waited for permission—they were built by those who dared to begin. Every framework you use today was once just an idea in someone's mind, just like the ideas in yours right now.

Vista exists because we believe the next revolution in web development won't come from big corporations—it will come from *you*. From late nights of curiosity. From that stubborn refusal to accept "that's just how it's done."

So build. Break things. Learn. And most importantly—**ship your ideas into the world**.

The future of the web is being written today. Make sure your code is part of that story.

*Built with passion, curiosity, and an unreasonable belief in what's possible.*
