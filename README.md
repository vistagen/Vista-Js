Vista is a modern, high-performance React framework built for the creators of tomorrow. It combines the component model of React with the raw speed of Rust, delivering an unparalleled development experience and lightning-fast production builds.

## 🚀 Powers & Features

Vista is designed to be the foundation for the next generation of web applications:

*   **React Server Components (RSC):** Default server-side rendering for optimal performance and zero-bundle-size components.
*   **Rust-Powered Core:** Built with Rust and SWC for blazing fast transpilation, minification, and bundling.
*   **Instant HMR:** Hot Module Replacement that scales with your project, keeping development feedback loops instant.
*   **File-Based Routing:** Intuitive routing system based on the file system structure.
*   **TypeScript Native:** First-class TypeScript support out of the box.
*   **Streaming SSR:** Stream content to the client as it's generated, improving perceived load times.
*   **Global Layouts:** Powerful layout system for persistent naming and state.
*   **Optimized Image Component:** Built-in `vista/image` for automatic image optimization.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

Vista is built on the shoulders of giants:

*   **Rust:** For the core CLI, file scanning, and performance-critical tasks.
*   **React 19:** Leveraging the latest React features including Server Components and Actions.
*   **SWC:** For super-fast JavaScript/TypeScript compilation.
*   **Webpack 5:** Highly tuned for module bundling (with Rust-based loaders).
*   **Node.js:** For the server runtime environment.
